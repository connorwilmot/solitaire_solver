A solitaire solver that currently solves a variant of FreeCell. In this variation, cards being placed on others must match suits, kings
cannot be placed on empty cascades, and the initial setup is 10 cascades with 5 cards each with 2 cards starting in the free cells.
This project was inspired by the thought "Is this game still possible?" while playing my family's version of FreeCell.
